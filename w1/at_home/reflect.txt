From this lecture, i learned how to make files from Putty and Visual Studio. 
And learned how to output the sentense what I want to show up. 
In my opinion, Visual Studio was better to run because while we build and debug
 we know what went to wrong exactly. However the Putty was to hard to know what 
I did wrong.
