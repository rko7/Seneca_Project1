1. In my opinion the "If" statement is the best way to run this code. It is because
the If statement makes the coding structure more clear and simpler.

2. The reason why a C string that is required to store up to 25 characters must
be capable of storing 26 characters is we need a terminator element which is
refer to null terminater at the end of the meaningful character in the string.
Since the index indentify the null terminator element as the number of meaningful
characters in the string we need one extra character even we try to store up
25 characters.
