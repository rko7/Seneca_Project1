1. I think the most important things I learned in this workshop are coding a
simple calculation using C operatior and expressions and casting a value from
a data typle to another.

2. The reason why I must add .005 to the value is because it will correct any
rouning errors.

3. Basically the casting opporatin helps conversion from one type to another. 
Through multiplying the amount which was originally double, by 100 and cast to 
an int, modulus could work.

4. I was required to use the modulus operator in this workshop because
modulus uses multiple operating functions such as division, multiplication,
additon and subtraction.
